# Static-Comp---Masters

A Turing Mod 2 project by [Eric Rabun](https://github.com/errabun)


### Description
This small project was to create a comp of an given page in a 4 day span.  It was purely design aspects that were involved in this project, so no functionality, just CSS and HTML practice.  The main goal for myself in this project was to get more practice with semantic HTML elements, as well as to continue to work with using responsive layouts in CSS using screen media queries.  We were given the freedom to not stick to trying to recreate the comp exactly, so I decided to use some golf data as I was working on this project during the Masters tournament which inspired my design. 
### Comp and My Design
This was the comp that we were required to recreate:

This is my recreation of the comp with some different data:

)
### Technologies Implemented:
- HTML
- CSS
### Challenges and Wins
Seeing at this project was just design focused, there weren't too many challenges that I ran into. The only thing that stumped me was trying to overlay anything over an exisitng image, which I was not able to complete within the time constraints.  Getting more practice using grid layouts, importing a icon package, implementing a mobile design first before scaling up to larger screen sizes, as well as utilizing semantic HTML were all wins on this project.
